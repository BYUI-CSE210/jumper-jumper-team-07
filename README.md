# Jumper
Jumper is a game that's similar to hangman, where you have to guess letters to a
hidden word and see if you can guess the whole word before the ficticious "Jumper" 
or the hangman in this case, loses his parachute and dies. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.9.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. 
Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by 
running the following command.
```
python3 jumper 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
